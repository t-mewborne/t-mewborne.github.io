                            <p>Hi! My name is Travis. I am a Master's of Cybersecurity student at Northeastern University. In May 2022, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                                at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. I am actively searching for oppurtunities to apply my Cybersecurity skills in the Boston area for
                                the Summer of 2023. I am also interested in remote or hybrid oppurtunities.

                                In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors. I like spending time at the beach and in the mountains.
                                I have been interested in photography my whole life, and enjoy taking photos on outdoor excursions.
                                I even take my photography skills underwater, as I am also a scuba diver. I hold both PADI and NAUI advanced diving certiications.
                                I enjoy imporiving my home's network design and security.
                                I also enjoy some personal Software Projects, such as writing Java applicaitons and designing Websites.
