                        <h3 id=withImage>
                            Over one summer, Dr. Tan of Trinity University and I researched the possibility to use Bluetooth radio signals to determine the location of a smartwatch in space.
                            Dr. Tan and I are actively working on this project.
                            The overarching goal of this project is to enhance driver safety.
                            By using the Bluetooth signal strength, we want to estimate the location of a smartwatch relative a steering wheel. 
                            Ultimately, the application will use this information to determine if the driver is not focused on driving.

                            You wake up in your home next to a bottle of pills, wearing a hospital bracelet. Your memory is foggy. Your child is severly ill and unresponsive.
                            You set out to the hospital name from your bracelet to find a cure. As time progresses, you get sicker and sicker. Taking the pills you found temporarily
                            alleviates the turning. It's your job to solve mysteries, find the cure, and escapte the hospital before it is too late.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The turning is a thrilling tilemap game. The object of the game is to find the cure and escape the hospital. The player must gather ingredients to find the cure.
                            The ingrediants are placed around the map. Each ingredient has a unique puzzle required for completion in order to obtain it. Once all ingredients are found, the player
                            can make their way to the labratory bench to put them all together for a final vaccine.

                            Dr. Phelps has an ambition to help those suffering with depresison and low self esteem. Dr. Phelps wants to help people change negative thoughts towards themselves into positive 
                            ones. At a helath and biotech hackathon, Dr. Phelps recruited a team of Trinity University students to help her design an application for this cause. I was lucky enough to be a part 
                            of this team. We created an application to help users boost their inner confidence and find their "InnerAlly." The application coaches the user to a more positive well being. It has 
                            the user write down goals for the day. It has an assessment for the user to determine the user's personality, and find his/her/their own personal InnerAlly. The application also has 
                            daily notifications with inspirational quotes.

                            Jump4Justice is the first Unity game I created with a team. The goal of the game is to defeat the boss enemy and save the victim. Platforms are randomly generated each time, and many
                            henchmen block the path to the boss enemy and the victim. The player has the ability defy gravity and jump multiple times mid air, however the amount of times the player can continue 
                            jumping is limited. The blue bar on the top right indicates how much "Jump Power" the player has left.

                            Utilized Q-Learning to create an Artificially Intelligent text-based werewolf for the card game "Werewolf." The project framework was obtained from the "AI Wolf" yearly competition based in Japan. 
                            At the end of every day, each werewolf will vote on a player of the villager team to “Attack”. The player with the highest number of votes will be attacked. 
                            Additionally, The werewolves have access to the “whisper” channel that can only be heard by other werewolves.
