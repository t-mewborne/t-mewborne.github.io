                            <h3>Over one summer, Dr. Sheng Tan of Trinity University and I researched the possibility to use Bluetooth radio signals to determine the location of a smartwatch in space. Dr. Tan and I are actively working on this project. The overarching goal of this project is to enhance driver safety. By using the Bluetooth signal strength, we want to estimate the location of a smartwatch relative a steering wheel. Ultimately, the application will use this information to determine if the driver is not focused on driving.</h3>

Dr. Phelps wants to help people change negative thoughts towards themselves into positive ones. At a helath and biotech hackathon, Dr. Phelps recruited a team of Trinity University students to help her design an application for this cause. I was lucky enough to be a part of this team. We created an application to help users boost their inner confidence and find their "InnerAlly." The application coaches the user to a more positive well being. It has the user write down goals for the day. It has an assessment for the user to determine the user's personality, and find his/her/their own personal InnerAlly. The application also has daily notifications with inspirational quotes.</h3>

Platforms are randomly generated each time, and many henchmen block the path to the boss enemy and the victim. The player has the ability defy gravity and jump multiple times mid air, however the amount of times the player can continue jumping is limited. The blue bar on the top right indicates how much "Jump Power" the player has left. This was a group project.</h3>
