Dr. Tan and I are actively working on this project. The overarching goal of this project is to enhance driver safety. By using the Bluetooth signal strength, we want to estimate the location of a smartwatch relative a steering wheel. Ultimately, the application will use this information to determine if the driver is not focused on driving.</h3>

Dr. Phelps wants to help people change negative thoughts towards themselves into positive ones. At a helath and biotech hackathon, Dr. Phelps recruited a team of Trinity University students to help her design an application for this cause. I was lucky enough to be a part of this team. We created an application to help users boost their inner confidence and find their "InnerAlly." The application coaches the user to a more positive well being. It has the user write down goals for the day. It has an assessment for the user to determine the user's personality, and find his/her/their own personal InnerAlly. The application also has daily notifications with inspirational quotes.</h3>
                            <h3>My team, consisting of the youngest and least experienced hacakthon participants, won first prize in the competition.</h3>

The blue bar on the top right indicates how much "Jump Power" the player has left. This was a group project.</h3>
